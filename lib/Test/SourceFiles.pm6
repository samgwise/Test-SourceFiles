=head1 NAME

Test::SourceFiles - A basic compilation checker

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test;
  use Test::SourceFiles;

  use-libs-ok;

  done-testing

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::SourceFiles is a simple way to check the compilation of all files in your projects C<lib/> directory.
I found myself rewriting this a couple of times so time to make a module.

The simple way is to call the C<use-libs-ok> function which calls C<Test::use-ok> on each module name returned from the collecting function, C<collect-sources>.
Alternately you can call C<collect-sources> and do something fancy with it's C<Seq> of C<Pair>'s where the key is a C<::> formatted name and the value is the C<IO::Path> where it was found.
For example:
=begin code
say collect-sources.perl
# prints ("Test::SourceFiles" => IO::Path.new("lib/Test/SourceFiles.pm6", ...),).Seq
=end code


Both functions have the following options and defaults:
=item C<Str :$root-path = 'lib'> - Where to search for source files
=item C<List :$extensions = list 'pm6'> - Which file extensions to include
=item C<Bool :$verbose = False> - Provide more detailed feedback on the search process

=head2 Use Case

I find this module particularly useful when I'm starting a project, a time where I'm creating a lot of files while stubbing functions and roles.
This module weeds out syntax errors from this sketching stage, allowing for a smoother transition into the implementation stage of the development process.
As a module matures and it's test suite fills in this module begins to become less useful and so can likely removed later in a module's life.
